This was a week long game jam with the theme of &quot;What's Behind the Door?&quot; I worked alongside Ben Bonus, as usual for my game jams. This was our first attempt at both a horror ggame and a 3D game. We ended up with the idea of medieval, escape room, horror game. The further through this old manor you go, the more the horror elements come in. We've heard some of the puzzles were confusing, but overall this is my favorite project so far. The game is best played downloaded, but can be played in the browser."

								data-desc="Nocturne of the Forest is a game made in Unity for the Pirate Software Game Jam 15. This was a two week long game jame with the theme of &quot;Shadows and Alchemy&quot;. I worked alongside Ben Bonus, as usual for my game jams. Our concept for this game was inspired by the game Moonlighter. This is definitely our largest scoped project overall. The game includes a tutorial area, a shop simulator, a robust inventory system, a crafting menu, and a forest dungeon. The gameplay loop is the player goes out into woods at night to collect materialss for their shop, they can find key items to unlock more of the forest, collect recipes and lore pages, return to the shop, craft items, price items at their shop, and sell items to townsfolk. Eventually, the player can open a portal in the final area of the forest and complete the game. The game is best played downloaded, but can be played in the browser."

								data-desc="Bullet Blitz is a game made in Unity for the Brackeys Game Jam 2023.1. This was a week long game jame with the theme &quot;an end is a new beginning&quot;.  I worked alongside Ben Bonus, as usual for my game jams. This was the first game we ever did and really the first game I ever made. We weren't quite sure how to meet the theme, so we decided that rougelike elements were fairly fiting. We also decided a bullet hell would be cool, because who doesn't love chaos. Everytime you start a run in this game, your stats are completely randomized including size, speed, dash distance, dash cooldown, and vision radius. The only goal is to survive as long as possible with waves of enemies increasing in number and difficulty. Obviously, the game isn't perfect (especially with no audio), but we were learning everything as we went and honestly I think it's great for a first game. The game is best played downloaded, but can be played in the browser."

								data-desc="Galf is a game made in Unity for the UDC Jam #27. This was a week long game jame with the theme &quot;one hit&quot;. I worked alongside Ben Bonus, as usual for my game james. We knew that a lot of people would choose a game where you die whenever you get hit, so we decided to make a more unique game about golfing. In Galf, you have to hit the ball into the hole with a single swing, one hit. Unfortunately, we had planned for both us to put in a reasonable amount of time, but Ben ended up being very busy that week. Our scope was for 2 people, but ended up more like 1.5 people. Despitte the game not having as much time put in as we would've like, I still think it's a fun game. The game is best played downloaded, but can be played in the browser."
